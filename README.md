## Summary

This project will explore methods for building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to differentiate images between cats and dogs. This somewhat trivial task for humans is a complicated and time consuming process for a desktop computer. Exploiting the resources available on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/deep-learning-vm), this project will test a number of different CNNs in order to achieve a target accuracy of 90% or greater.

Although we recognize that this can be accomplished easily via transfer learning with one of the famous CNN architectures, that was not done in this project as we were attempting to build a CNN from scratch to maximize the learning.

## Results

Utilizing learning rate scheduling and data augmentation we were able to build a CNN with 97% acccuracy and a balanced confusion matrix with nearly equal misclassified images. We are extremely satisified with this result and hope you enjoy the project.
